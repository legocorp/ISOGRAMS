# ISOGRAMS - Custom Dashboard and Buttons

Welcome to ISOGRAMS, a custom dashboard interface for Home Assistant designed to be simple, intuitive, and free from information overload.

## Overview

After equipping my flat with smart technology, I developed this dashboard to streamline control and monitoring. It's optimized for landscape mode on a Lenovo Tab M8 with a dock station, utilizing the Kiosk app for continuous operation. While it functions in portrait mode, the layout may appear differently.

**Note:** The sidebar is a modified version of the [sidebar card by DBuit](https://github.com/DBuit/sidebar-card). Due to permission considerations, this modified sidebar isn't included in this repository.

## Themes

Two themes accompany the dashboard:

- **ISOGRAMS - Light**

- **ISOGRAMS - Dark**
